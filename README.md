# Binary Trees

This repository contains a series of projects focused on binary trees, completed as part of the curriculum at Holberton School. The projects were developed collaboratively by Quentin Lepoutre and Anzo Hitte.

## Description

This repository includes implementations of various functions to manipulate binary trees. The project aims to deepen understanding of binary tree data structures and their operations.

## Project Files

- `binary_trees.h`: Header file containing all the function prototypes, struct definitions, and any necessary libraries.

### Functions

1. **Binary Tree Node Creation**
   - `0-binary_tree_node.c`: Function to create a binary tree node.
  
2. **Insertion**
   - `1-binary_tree_insert_left.c`: Function to insert a node as the left-child of another node.
   - `2-binary_tree_insert_right.c`: Function to insert a node as the right-child of another node.

3. **Deletion**
   - `3-binary_tree_delete.c`: Function to delete an entire binary tree.

4. **Check Functions**
   - `4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c`: Function to check if a node is a leaf.
   - `5-binary_tree_is_root.c`: Function to check if a node is a root.

5. **Traversal**
   - `6-binary_tree_preorder.c`: Function for pre-order traversal of a binary tree.
   - `7-binary_tree_inorder.c`: Function for in-order traversal of a binary tree.
   - `8-binary_tree_postorder.c`: Function for post-order traversal of a binary tree.

6. **Measurement**
   - `9-binary_tree_height.c`: Function to measure the height of a binary tree.
   - `10-binary_tree_depth.c`: Function to measure the depth of a node in a binary tree.
   - `11-binary_tree_size.c`: Function to measure the size of a binary tree.
   - `12-binary_tree_leaves.c`: Function to count the leaves in a binary tree.
   - `13-binary_tree_nodes.c`: Function to count the nodes with at least 1 child in a binary tree.
   - `14-binary_tree_balance.c`: Function to measure the balance factor of a binary tree.

7. **Binary Tree Properties**
   - `15-binary_tree_is_full.c`: Function to check if a binary tree is full.
   - `16-binary_tree_is_perfect.c`: Function to check if a binary tree is perfect.

8. **Relational Operations**
   - `17-binary_tree_sibling.c`: Function to find the sibling of a node.
   - `18-binary_tree_uncle.c`: Function to find the uncle of a node.

## How to Use

Each C file in this repository contains a specific function that operates on a binary tree. To use these functions, include the `binary_trees.h` header file in your project and compile the C files with your code.
